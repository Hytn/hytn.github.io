My research goal is to understand and develop AI for automating routine, mechanical, and repetitive tasks that are necessary but do not require creative thinking. I work on automating the data-driven scientific research for contributing to both alleviating the burden on humans and revolutionizing human productivity. My research experience focuses on automating the Real-World Data-Driven Research and Development (R&D) cycle in the financial domain, analyzing and correcting the decision rules of deep models (e.g., language models) in their real-world applications such as legal judgment prediction (LJP) and knowledge extraction (e.g., relation extraction), and improving the performance, robustness, and out-of-distribution generalization ability of deep models in these applications.
